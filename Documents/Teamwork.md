# Teamwork

> Please use Git/TODO/Telegram group to share information.

## Git

> Because the team contains only three members, I simplify the process.

I initialize the private repo in GitHub, which I have invited you a the member.

Every time before you work, please use `git pull` to keep track of our main project.

**Please submit your work to dev branch.**

## TODO

I'll distribute the work through TODO, every new work contains a step named `get it`, if you see the work, check `get it` to sign.

I hope you can finish the work before due date.
